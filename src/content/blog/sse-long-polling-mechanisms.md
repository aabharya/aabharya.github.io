description: In web development, polling is a technique used to retrieve updated information from a server by periodically sending requests. The client regularly checks for new data by making HTTP requests at fixed intervals. While simple to implement, polling can be inefficient as it may lead to unnecessary requests even when there is no new information.

## Server-Sent Events (SSE)

Server-Sent Events provide a more efficient and real-time alternative to polling. SSE is a standard that enables servers to push updates to web clients over a single, long-lived HTTP connection. This one-way communication allows servers to initiate the data transfer, reducing the need for repeated requests from the client. SSE is particularly useful for applications requiring instant updates, such as live feeds or notifications.

## Long Polling

Long polling is another method for achieving real-time communication between a client and a server. Instead of the client repeatedly polling the server, the server holds the request open until new data is available. Once new data is ready, the server responds to the client's request, and the process repeats. Long polling strikes a balance between real-time communication and server efficiency, making it a viable option for certain applications.

## Conclusion

While polling, Server-Sent Events, and long polling each have their advantages and trade-offs, the choice depends on the specific requirements of the web application. Polling is straightforward but can be resource-intensive. SSE is efficient for one-way communication, while long polling balances real-time updates with reduced server load. Developers should carefully consider the application's needs when choosing the appropriate mechanism for real-time communication.
